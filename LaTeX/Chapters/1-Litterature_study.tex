For the forward problem, it is difficult to obtain analytical solutions for most of the
models related to consolidation.

Researchers have revealed that PINNs possess the following advantages compared with the conventional mesh-based numerical methods in tackling the forward problem. 
First, PINNs is capable of solving the inverse problem with the only minor change of the code that is used in a forward problem (Liu and Wang, 2019). Secondly, neural network-based methods with mesh-free features can reduce the tedious work of mesh generation (Basir and Senocak, 2022). 
Thirdly, PINNs can obtain remarkably accurate solutions and reliable parameter estimations with fewer data and average-quality data, to reduce the dependence on the need for large training datasets (Zhang et al., 2021). Fourthly, PINNs can produce results at any point in the domain once it has been trained (Basir and Senocak, 2022).
